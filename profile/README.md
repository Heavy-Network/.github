## Welcome to Heavy Network
<br>
Heavy Network was created by Juliya Gannon in 2017. Originally created with local bands in mind, it offers musicians free websites to establish themselves online without a predatory record label contract.

Before she even touched on using Static Sites for this organization, Juliya did 3 years of research on how to accomplish everything a band might need with a static site. Monte Luna was kind of enough to give her unrestricted access into their band, metrics, and audience. Using this research, Juliya designed several solutions for bands, including integrations with tools musicians already use (Spotify, Bandcamp, Ticket Master, whatever), Calendar support fans can sync their own to so they never miss a show, EPK's, a band blog if wanted, the possibilities are endless.

Before Covid happened, Juliya had research that proved bands needed to change focus if they were to survive our ever changing digital world. She suggested Live Streams, Fan Interaction, Personal Touches (and much more!) to bands to increase their engagement. Then, Covid happened, everyone was at home, and the bands who listened to her found success online despite the lockdowns.

Juliya pushed the brakes on Heavy Network right before Covid, due to Monte Luna signing a record deal, something that was stressed couldn't happen while they were working with her. Because of this, she could not finish the site for them, which would've been the example for others. 

I won't lie, this almost pulled the plug on this passion project. But, I am back now. I want to try again. My research is still useful, and I have amazing instincts.

At the end of the day, all this is is a way to get a free website as a band from someone who cares about your success and wants to see you reach it without a record label. If you are a band or musician in need of a website, please contact me.
